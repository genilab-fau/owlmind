# Model Orchestrate Documentation

## Overview
The `model_orchestrate` method is part of an advanced AI agent designed to dynamically select and execute machine learning models based on incoming workflows and predefined rules. This document provides a detailed breakdown of its functionality, rules, capabilities, and the associated directory structure for implementation.

---


## **Core Concept**
The `model_orchestrate` method is integrated into a GenAI pipeline that interacts with various components as illustrated in the workflow diagram. The pipeline processes a `Session` object containing:
- **original_prompt**: The unaltered input from the user.
- **formed_prompt**: A refined version of the original prompt, shaped by prior workflows.
- **workflow_id**: Identifier for the workflow applied to the session.

The method operates within the **Model Orchestration** stage of the GenAI pipeline and:
1. Selects the **target model** based on:
   - A **Model Repository** (metadata about available models and prior interactions).
   - Workflow rules specified in **Model Orchestration Rules**.
2. Executes the model, ensuring cost-efficiency, low latency, and adherence to accuracy requirements.

## **Workflow Integration**

The workflow integrates the following key components:

1. **Interface**:
   - Includes the WebUI and chatbot components where user prompts originate.
   - Passes user inputs (P) into the GenAI pipeline and receives responses (R).

2. **GenAI Pipeline**:
   - Composed of three stages:
     - **Workflow Select**: Determines the appropriate workflow template based on the user input.
     - **Workflow Execute**: Executes the selected workflow, preparing inputs for model orchestration.
     - **Model Orchestration**: Dynamically selects and invokes the optimal model for execution.

3. **Model Orchestration Rules**:
   - Define how models are selected based on cost, latency, and accuracy constraints.

4. **Artifacts and Databases**:
   - Contain reusable components and data required for workflows and model execution.

5. **Orchestration**:
   - Manages high-level operations, ensuring smooth communication between components.

## **Workflow Rules**
The system uses a structured set of rules within the **Model Orchestration** stage to determine which model to execute. These rules follow a hierarchical decision-making process:

### **Rule 1: Target Model**
If a `target_model` is specified in the workflow:
- Query the execution environments to determine:
  - **Latency**: Where can the model run the fastest?
  - **Cost**: Which environment is most economical?
  - **Availability**: Ensure the target model is online.

### **Rule 2: Suggested Models**
If a list of `suggested_models` is provided:
- Perform a **meta-analysis** to evaluate the best option based on:
  - Accuracy
  - Cost
  - Latency
  - Historical performance from the Model Repository.
- Optionally, use an ensemble approach if multiple models are equally viable.

### **Rule 3: Expected Model**
If an `expected_model` is provided:
- Derive the `target_model` by analyzing the session's:
  - Query complexity (low/medium/high).
  - Required accuracy.
  - Budget and latency sensitivity.

### **Rule 4: Undefined Model (Fallback)**
If no model is specified:
1. Analyze the `formed_prompt` using a meta-model or heuristic.
2. Derive an `expected_model` (accuracy, latency, and cost).
3. Backtrack to **Rule 3**.

## **Capabilities**
### **Input Analysis**
- **Purpose**: Evaluate the `formed_prompt` to infer model requirements.
- **Implementation**:
  - Token analysis (query complexity).
  - Intent detection (e.g., factual, creative, or technical query).

### **Model Selection**
- **Purpose**: Match query requirements to available models in the Model Repository.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use metadata to align query needs with model capabilities.
  - Rank models based on a weighted scoring system.

### **Meta-Analysis**
- **Purpose**: Evaluate multiple suggested models to recommend the best option.
- **Implementation**:
  - Compare based on accuracy, cost, latency, and historical performance.

### **Model Invocation**
- **Purpose**: Execute the selected model in the most efficient environment.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use APIs or orchestration frameworks (e.g., Kubernetes) for execution.

## **Prompts**
Prompts define how the inner-Agent interacts with the system to make decisions:

### Prompt 1: Query Analysis (Undefined Model)
**Input**: `formed_prompt`
**Goal**: Infer `expected_model` requirements.
**Example**:
```
You are a model-selection assistant. Based on the following prompt:
"{formed_prompt}"
Determine:
- Query complexity (low/medium/high).
- Expected accuracy level (low/medium/high).
- Latency sensitivity (low/medium/high).
- Cost sensitivity (low/medium/high).
```

### Prompt 2: Meta-Analysis (Suggested Models)
**Input**: List of suggested models and metadata.
**Goal**: Rank models based on criteria.
**Example**:
```
You are a meta-analysis assistant. Compare the following models:
{model_list}
Based on:
- Query complexity: {query_complexity}
- Accuracy requirement: {accuracy_requirement}
- Cost sensitivity: {cost_sensitivity}
- Latency sensitivity: {latency_sensitivity}
Recommend the best model for execution.
```

### Prompt 3: Execution Plan (Target Model)
**Input**: `target_model`, execution environments.
**Goal**: Select the optimal environment.
**Example**:
```
You are an execution optimizer. For the model "{target_model}" and the following environments:
{environment_list}
Recommend the best environment based on cost and latency.
```
